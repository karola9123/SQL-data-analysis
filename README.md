🎬 Netflix Content Analysis
This project explores the structure of Netflix’s catalog using data available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows). The goal was to extract key insights about the type, volume, and characteristics of the content available on the platform.

📊 Tools used:

PostgreSQL – data querying and transformation
Excel – data cleaning, pivot tables, charts
Canva – report design and layout

📎 Files included:

queries.sql – all SQL queries used in the analysis, with comments
Netflix Content Analysis.pdf – full analysis report with charts, conclusions, and Excel-based calculations

🔍 Metrics and Questions Analyzed:

Distribution of content types – share of Movies vs TV Shows in the entire catalog
Yearly growth of the platform – how many titles were added each year
Number of Titles per Release Year
Top 10 Most Frequent Directors
Genre vs runtime – identifying which genres tend to be the longest or shortest

🧠 Notable insights:

Netflix significantly increased its catalog size between 2016 and 2020
The U.S. dominates the platform’s content origin
"International Movies" tend to have the longest runtimes, possibly due to art-house cinema
Shorter movies are mostly documentaries
